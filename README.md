## 🎯 How It Works

The app leverages React's state management to dynamically filter products based on user input. The filtering logic combines multiple criteria:

1. **Search Term**: Filters products whose names contain the search query
2. **Category**: Matches exact category selections
3. **Price Range**: Applies numerical comparisons for min/max prices

All filters work together seamlessly, updating the product list instantly as users interact with the interface.
